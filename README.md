<h1>IT Governance Maturity Assessment â€“ Financial Institution</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

I led an IT governance maturity assessment for a mid-sized financial institution using the COBIT 2019 framework. Working directly with executives and IT leaders, I uncovered critical gaps in oversight, project management, risk integration, and compliance monitoring. My assessment covered the EDM, APO, BAI, DSS, and MEA domains, leveraging executive interviews, KPI reviews, and strategic analysis to build an accurate governance maturity baseline.

<h2>Summary</h2>

To address the identified gaps, I designed a tailored governance roadmap that aligned IT initiatives with business strategy, improved compliance practices, and strengthened accountability.

 Key recommendations included:

- Establish a dedicated IT Governance Board
- Implement a project portfolio management process
- Introduce enterprise architecture planning
- Embed compliance automation into governance cycles

I presented these recommendations in a board-level session, along with a phased 12-month roadmap to support adoption. The institution implemented my roadmap, created a permanent IT Governance Committee, reduced project delays by 30%, improved regulatory readiness, and increased executive confidence in IT governance and risk management practices.
