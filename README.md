<h1>IT Governance Assessment Using COBIT Framework</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<br />
I led an IT goverance maturity assessment for a financial institution using the COBIT 2019 framework. I worked directly with executives and IT leaders to uncover gaps in oversight, risk integration, and project management. I then designed a tailored governance roadmap that aligned IT initiatives with business strategy, improved compliance practices, and introduced stronger accountability. My recommendations were adopted, leading to a 30% drop in project delays, enhanced regulatory readiness, and greater executive confidence in IT governance.

<h2>Assessment</h2>

I was engaged by a mid-sized financial institution facing challenges in aligning IT initiatives with business strategy. I conducted a full IT governance maturity assessment using the COBIT 2019 framework, focusing on the EDM, APO, BAI, DSS, and MEA domains. Through executive interviews, KPI reviews, and strategic analysis, I identified governance gaps including weak oversight, inconsistent project management, limited risk integration, and siloed compliance monitoring.

I delivered a COBIT-aligned governance roadmap with practical recommendations:<br> 
- Establishing an IT Governance Board<br>
- Implementing a project portfolio management process<br>
- Introducing enterprise architecture planning<br>
- Embedding compliance automation into governance cycles

To ensure adoption, I presented findings and a phased 12-month roadmap directly to senior management in a board-level presentation.

The institution implemented my roadmap, creating a permanent IT Governance Committee, reducing project delays by 30%, improving regulatory readiness, and increasing executive confidence in IT governance and risk management practices.
